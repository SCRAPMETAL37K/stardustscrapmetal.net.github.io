        <h2>two different blankets</h2>
        <h3>august 9, 2025 - 12:38 pm</h3>
        
        <p>
            Recently, Daniel Ek (CEO of Spotify) invested $700 million worth of Spotify stock into the European defense firm Helsing, a company that specializes in AI fighter drone technology and 
            that Ek also now chairs. It is clear that Ek uses Spotify as a tool merely to pursue his own financial interests; it was never about pushing, discovering, and creating art that fought 
            back, soothed, and guided us through life. Another billionaire doing billionaire things, nothing new here.
        </p>

        <p>
            There comes a point where we should ask ourselves why we still use this platform. Spotify has more users than any other music streaming platform and offers essentially no significant benefit 
            compared to any other platform. Spotify is more expensive than essentially every other platform, it degrades the art it serves us by denying us access to lossless audio, and refuses to pay and 
            support the artists who have supplied the platform with its content and ad revenue.
        </p>

        <p>
            Artists have routinely found that music labels of all sizes have cooperated with Spotify in adjusting the terms of how art is made and distributed. AI-generated music now makes up a 
            significant portion of the content uploaded onto the platform, and some artists have even found that this slop is added to their official page without their consent or knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have, essentially, created a leech that sucks on us for no discernible reason. Their business model solely relies on you to turn off your brain and not care about the blatant bullshit 
            they pull over your head. We have cultivated a culture of “chill” playlists and algorithmically recommended radio stations, anti-intellectualist consumerism and a complete disengagement 
            with the art so many worked so hard for you to pick apart and cherish. It is a fully harmful act to the people who pour every bit of themselves into what they create and to ourselves, as 
            active listeners and people who engage in the world around us. To me, it was an obvious choice to cancel my Spotify subscription, and if you have empathy at all, it will be obvious to you 
            too.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Piracy has always played a strange part in the music industry in particular. I can only venture a guess as to why. The way I see it, culture should not only be available to those who are 
            able to afford it. The music that our parents and our friends listened to was inescapable, it was part of our growing up. With the dawn of the internet age, we were given access to 
            everything everywhere all at once. We wanted to share with others across the globe the way we lived and the way we saw. Spotify just happened to take advantage of this weird gap in the 
            industry at the time. They tried to be the cool kid on the block that found the middle ground between supporting artists and outright stealing from them. Naively, we all thought this was 
            exciting at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Music more so than other mediums I think, is deeply rooted in the history and culture of our immediate surroundings. Music, especially good music, is felt through physical movement 
            because the music was us. To make mistakes is to be human and those mistakes are none the more potent than in an improvised guitar riff at a slightly off-kilter tempo. The shiver 
            that runs through your spine as a result is the very essence of music itself. Art can move you but only music can make your body beg you for movement.
        </p>

        <p>
            The time of American boy bands is now a bygone era, but at the time, it was emblematic of how a certain group of people led their lives. It was representative of the way they perceived 
            others and themselves. It held our values and beliefs in a Y2K shaped box. To me, thinking about New York City is impossible without also thinking about A Tribe Called Quest, the Wu-Tang 
            Clan, The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, and other Hip-Hop legends from the 90s. England is sort of synonymous with The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and other revolutionary acts from the 
            60s and 70s that shaped guitar playing and musical storytelling in general for the betterment of today. We take pride in the fact that these people were from where we were from. They made 
            music about us, for us, and with us.
        </p>

        <p>
            The internet has given us this beautiful gift, to share ourselves more completely and faster than we ever have before. It has allowed artists to mesh and bend worlds together to create art 
            we wouldn’t have without the internet. A blending across cultures is what makes our current moment particularly unique and interesting in the world of art. However, it has come to the point where platforms like 
            Spotify are here to tell us that they know who we are better than we do. By Spotify succeeding in the way it has, we as a society have essentially said, “You’re right. We do not want to 
            put in the hard work ourselves.”
        </p>

        <p>
            To endeavor to understand the artist’s complete idea is to confront difficult questions about the way we live. This is something that the broader public does not value and does not care 
            about, as we have let the rights to ourselves slip into the hands of warmongering cowards who now control the marketplace of culture. We have given this up in exchange for the privilege of 
            ease of consuming. In doing so we eroded the very fabric of our existence that we built ourselves. Daniel Ek has effectively walked into our home, tossed a hammer straight through the 
            television, and asked us to pay him twelve bucks for the inconvenience. Look, if you’re okay with watching The Lion King remade three more times over the next fifty years then so be it, 
            but I want my damn soul back.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Personal philosophy aside, what can we do? Stop paying for Spotify. I don’t think we need to boycott all streaming services forever, that seems a bit unreasonable and unrealistic to me. 
            From my very limited research and biased opinion, Apple Music and Tidal are probably the best alternatives. They both offer lossless audio quality (which may or may not matter depending 
            on who you talk to; most people can’t reliably tell the difference) and they both pay artists significantly more than Spotify. Apple Music also has one of, if not the largest, catalog of 
            classical recordings, which I think is pretty dope. I understand there might be some hesitation with hopping from one big tech company to another but there really is no other option that 
            is less financially burdensome.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’re an artist, you can take your music off of Spotify. Odds are you probably aren’t getting paid much of anything to begin with but there are definitely artists whose main income comes 
            from streaming, so that might be difficult. Especially if the rights to your music are split between labels, featured artists, ex-bandmates, etc. Managing that could be a bit of a 
            nightmare for some.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, going to see your favorite artists on tour and buying something from the merch booth is probably the best way to support them. I can’t emphasize more the importance of physical 
            media as well, given the music we listen to on streaming services is merely a license to stream and not ownership. Meaning your access to it can be revoked at any time for any reason. 
            Whatever is within your means and capabilities is more than acceptable. Until we begin to burn down the current infrastructure and rebuild from the ground up to make systems that are fair 
            and equitable for all, I think you can rest easy knowing that you are doing all that you are able to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            Piracy is, of course, always an option. I strongly believe in a world where all information is freely available to those who seek it. The same goes with culture. To deny someone the right 
            to the world they live in is ludicrous and to say that only people who can afford my awesome new psychedelic art pop mixtape are worthy of listening to it would be downright vile. I think
            most artists would be comfortable with you pirating their music, so long as if you come to a live show in the future, consider grabbing a t-shirt on your way out. I think most artists just
            want to be heard, and to have someone shout back at them.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t mean for this to be some kind of “Capitalism and technology is bad! Throw your phone out the window and go live in the woods!” kind of thing. Not everything is 
            our fault and we personally need not worry about every single injustice that happens in the world. We would never get anything done if we all had to be 100% attentive to every little thing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rather, the way we collectively have made choices to participate in institutions that routinely strip us of our own individualism, is something we should all be universally aware and 
            deeply ashamed of. We should not be ashamed that we made the choice in the first place, because we were tricked into it with the promise of a better future and a good bargain. Instead, 
            we should be ashamed that it’s taken us this long to do something about it. We live in a world where, if we are not vigilant, people and organizations alike will take advantage of our 
            laziness and our comfort because of the incentives set up by the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current day media landscape has morphed to meet these incentives as we have adapted to prefer them. In recent times, music has gotten shorter and louder, compressed to reduce dynamic 
            range and emotional versatility. Make no mistake, it's artistically less interesting in every way, but this formula has made hit song after hit song over the past decade and some change. 
            Video games have been inundated with micro-transactions and mini games that give us bursts of dopamine to get us hooked, then take away the cookie jar and ask us for our credit card as 
            soon as they know we want more. As much as the system works against our best interests, we make small choices everyday that tell the system it’s doing a good job. So we must constantly be 
            asking ourselves, what am I consuming, how am I consuming it, and why can’t I stop?
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember a concert I went to in Akron, Ohio. It was in a small college town house basement near the university. There were maybe thirty people that showed up, most of them involved in 
            the production, or playing in a band. This small house for some reason held a handful of arcade cabinets. I remember seeing a Seinfeld DVD hanging on a loose nail in the wall. Five or six 
            bands played that night. One of them had just formed and another had just changed their name for the eighth time. I didn’t know any of these bands except one, but nonetheless was impressed 
            with the passion and time that went into making something unapologetically them. You could see the fire in their eyes, and smell their nervousness in the air. There’s a hesitation with 
            sharing something so close to the heart that you just had to admire these people for even giving it a shot in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
            The band I was there to see was called american poetry club. They haven’t put out anything new recently, I think all the members have moved on to other projects. At the time I saw them 
            they were on a big tour, represented by their lead vocalist and main writer, Jordan Weinstock, and their drummer. In the middle of their set, Jordan said something I’ve thought about at 
            least once a week since then. I don’t remember their exact words but it was something to the tune of,
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>“It's so inspiring, seeing people make art in places that don't want you to make art.”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I walked up to the band and thanked them for their set. I bought a hoodie from them at the merch table, that 
            I would later donate to a Goodwill when I outgrew it. I told Jordan that I was happy that they played my favorite song and that I thought it was cool how they adapted it in a different 
            way for a live setting.
        </p>

        <p>
            They responded, <i>“Oh, I never knew anyone ever cared about that song.”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Music, like all art, has the ability to change the way we feel. Instantaneously, it can destroy us from the inside out, in a single loud burst. And just when you thought you've built 
            yourself back up again, it destroys you just the same. It is for this reason, that we need to protect it.
        </p>

            As always, thank you for reading. I appreciate you and hope you're taking good care of yourself. We all need a break every once and a while. Thanks for kicking it, I'll see you soon.
