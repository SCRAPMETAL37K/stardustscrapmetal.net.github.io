        <h2>I'll Play My Part</h2>
        <h3>May 24, 2025 - 2:10 AM</h3>
        
        <p>
            Everyday when you look into the mirror, you are greeted by someone you don’t know. We live inside our heads, but when you look into the mirror, you are struck with the reality that you 
            are real. You are really real. Our understanding of life tells us that we are our brain waves, our DNA, our personality. Beyond that though, you are muscle. An ever changing and evolving 
            forum of cells that replicate and replace. You may control and move the muscle but you are also the muscle. You are alive and you live and you breathe. You connect, share, discover, smell, 
            blink, feel, listen, taste, and create. In our minds we can be who we believe we are. On the outside, the muscle does these things too. It can move, make dinner, put clothes on, get 
            emotional, make mistakes, apologize, realize it’s too late. Everyday when you look into the mirror, you are asked if you are okay with this. You didn’t wish for this nor did anyone make 
            this decision for you. It happened regardless. Everyday when you look into the mirror, you are given a hundred thousand decisions to make. How many of those decisions do you think you are 
            in complete and utter control of? Of those, how many did you handle correctly? Of those, how many would you be brave enough to make the same decision again? Everyday when you look into the 
            mirror, you get a brief glimpse into the lives of a billion people you will never be but nonetheless are. Do you have respect for each and every one of them? Do you understand them? Can 
            you feel them on your shoulders or in your chest? If everyday you looked into the mirror, and instead you saw me. I wonder what you would say.

            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew I was bisexual when I met Frank. Not because I was attracted to him, although he was a good looking guy. We met in high school gym class my sophomore year. We were equally 
            unathletic and very much did not fit into the typical population of my all-boys, very Catholic prep school. I was always very nervous talking to him. My hands would shake standing next to 
            him while we changed out of our gym clothes into our formal school attire. We didn’t have much in common. I’m not really sure why we became friends. I think I was just willing to listen to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Frank was gay. He wore it proudly. He liked wearing makeup, he wore jewelry and carried a purse (all of the above was strictly against the school’s dress code). He was artsy. He had a 
            stereotypical gay voice. He’d share gossip with me in the locker room. He would disappear from school for a few days at a time to do modeling gigs in New York City or something like that. 
            Plenty of guys made fun of him for it. Maybe that’s putting it lightly, but Frank always seemed to be okay with it. Not because it wasn’t bad but because that’s just how it was. The school 
            was not going to change for him, so all he could do was stomach it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Frank was an extremely nice guy. He went out of his way to make you feel welcome. He was a warm, fuzzy kinda guy. If you were on his bad side, it was definitely your fault. He mostly hung 
            out with all the other gay guys. They had their own clique. It was a tight-knit group. I knew a couple of them. One of them had gone to the same elementary school as me, but I had since 
            lost touch with him. They were all pleasant people but it was never my crowd. I didn’t know what I know now. Maybe if I did it’d be a different story.
        </p>

        <p>
            Frank and I started drifting away from each other after our shared gym class ended that semester. We were never really that close and lived totally different lives. We would see each other 
            in the halls. I’d make eye contact, he’d wave. It’s okay, sometimes that happens. But I couldn’t stop thinking about him. He was such a light in my life for the time that he was in it. I 
            wish I had the opportunity to let him know.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’d hear about Frank from other people. He was always going on some kind of drama filled adventure. His life could easily be made into a Disney Channel Original Movie. Later, I’d hear that 
            he wanted to take a guy to prom. He had gone to the dean of the school personally to explicitly ask for permission to do so. Despite our school’s pro-pride marketing, the administration 
            turned Frank down. They had no reason to do this. No tangible bad would come of allowing two gay guys to go to prom together. Maybe a couple of parents would have made a stink about it had 
            they found out, but you don’t make new rules based on a couple of bad Yelp reviews. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It was bullshit. I remember no one really caring about any of this at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>“Who cares? Frank’s weird.”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>“Of course they didn’t let him. The administration doesn’t let us wear baseball caps or hoodies, why would they let two gay guys into prom?”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>“He could’ve just snuck in, why’d he have to go and ask for permission?”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            I was outraged. Frank was not the issue. The school is supposed to be better than this, in fact they had stood by LGBTQ+ groups in the past. They had made a promise. None of that 
            mattered I guess.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew I was bisexual in my junior year of high school. It didn’t happen all at once, but slowly over time the pieces fell into place. I knew I liked women, but I also liked men. 
            It was confusing to me, someone who had only really been exposed to a binary view. There were a lot of sleepless nights spent on BuzzFeed quizzes and various subreddits just trying to 
            make sense of it all. I read articles and blogs from people who had come out and were trying to pass along what information they knew and how they saw things. I watched gay porn, I 
            listened to music by queer artists, I knew I wasn’t straight. That’s where it all started.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had felt it happening in real time. At first, I couldn’t shake the thoughts. I would catch myself and get frustrated. I told myself that I wouldn’t do that anymore. I won’t think like 
            this, I won’t be like this. This isn’t me. Nobody can know that I’m like this. I tried to brush it off like a common cold and when that didn’t work I ran. I remember countless days in the 
            school library with my eyes shut and two earbuds in, blasting My Chemical Romance loud enough to make everything outside of the immediate confines of my armchair dissipate entirely. At 
            least for that moment. That only works for so long.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can run and run and run, sometimes out of fear, sometimes out of shame, sometimes out of desperation, sometimes because eventually that’s all you know how to do. It changed the way I 
            look at everyone around me. Armed with knowledge no one else has, I would stare directly into people’s eyes. Would you do something if you knew? Would you tell someone? Would you believe 
            me? Would you hold my hand? Have you ever spoken to someone you knew you would be speaking to for the last time? Have you ever shaken someone’s hand knowing that they would break your arm 
            if given the chance?
        </p>

        <p>
            It's difficult to think about how truly singular I felt. Recently, I’ve been thinking about the scene in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, where HAL severs the airtube connecting Dr. Pool to his oxygen 
            tank as he’s thrown out into the deep recesses of a cold and unrelenting infinite space. The movie cuts between Dr. Bowman, trying to rescue him, and Pool’s now lifeless nylon and spandex coffin 
            tumbling into nothing. Tumbling into nothing. Tumbling into nothing. For five minutes straight. No wall to stop him, no ground to catch him, no physics to slow him down. Relief does not 
            exist, not even in silence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Back then, I would’ve said I was losing my mind. Now I know that this kind of thing has a name. At the time, I had decided that there was no one that I could go to with any of this. 
            The world I had constructed did not allow for this to happen. I did not allow myself to be open, or to understand. I knew what I felt was real. I knew that I had to deal with it somehow. 
            I did not have the resources to do anything about it. Acceptance was not on the table. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In my distress, I did a lot of things I regret. I pushed a lot of people away. I isolated myself from everything I knew. I wanted to take my own life. I couldn’t bear to exist in a world 
            that didn’t want me. Acceptance was not on the table, but neither was letting go. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I carried on anyway. I’m not really sure why. There’s no quote I can give you. There’s no life changing TED Talk that I could recall. I just had to make it work somehow. If there was a 
            light at the end of the tunnel, I needed to see it. That was enough for me. If that existed, I had to know. If I cried every night, then I knew I was still alive — I still had more work to do. 
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew I was bisexual when I got to college. At this point, I was alright with it. I had come to terms with my reality. I knew it was part of who I was. If someone wasn’t okay with that, 
            it was their problem. College was a welcome change of pace. We had a very large and established LGBTQ+ community on campus. They were loud, but happy you were involved. By now, I was out 
            to my close friends, who had all shown nothing but unconditional support. Being part of this community was now a fact of my life whether I liked it or not, but I hadn’t realized how much 
            growing I still had to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew that I was bisexual but not what being bisexual was like. The LGBTQ+ community is one that takes on a life of its own. It moves and aches. It has arguments with itself and somehow 
            ends up losing most of them. Being bisexual was something well established. There are norms and expectations. I was given a label and asked to conform. Even though I had found a space for 
            me to live the way I wanted, the expectations given to me by the group had me nailed into a box that made me feel similarly to the way I did when I was still figuring it all out. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am very grateful for my friends in the community and everything they have given to me, but my lived experience has never felt like enough for anyone. I did not have it the hardest, I 
            haven’t sacrificed everything to be here, but I am enough. I always have been and as long as I keep trying my best to understand why I’m here and what the hell is going on, then I am 
            owed the right to be me. I don’t know everything there is to know about being queer, but I know who I am, I know how I got here, and that is enough to warrant your basic human decency and respect.
        </p>

        <p>
            The only label that can communicate a lived experience is a person’s name. Not some arbitrary boxes you can tick that roughly correlates you with your human behavior. You cannot feel a 
            label. You are unable to breathe through a label. It does not experience or grow with you. It is only allowed to be what it is strictly defined as. When we call someone gay, or black, or 
            disabled, or whatever, we necessarily limit their ability to represent themselves in their own way. We categorize because our society necessitates it, but we also let it carry over into 
            the way we perceive and understand each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this sense, I’ve never felt bisexual. Not because I am particularly different compared to most other bisexual people, but because the criteria ebbs and flows, changing depending on the 
            person and the environment. I am judged by the preconceived notions attached to a word that has no authority over who I am allowed to be. When we talk about acceptance, I think it’s 
            important to say out loud, “what is it that we are looking for?” Is it for the idea of “gay people” to be permissible? Or is it for you personally, to be valued, understood, and respected 
            for who you specifically are? When we give and are given labels, we often use them to distinguish and divide, but they distract us from the much more difficult goal of legitimizing each 
            other as a one people of a strange and harsh world.
        </p>

        <p>
            To clarify, I am not saying that LGBTQ+ rights is not a serious issue. Human rights belong to everyone regardless of sexuality, identity, race, religion, ethnicity, social class, etc. What I am 
            saying is if we want to create a more equal world for ourselves and for the future, we should start by outlining a space where you are able to be authentically you, without worrying about 
            falling short of something you could never be in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s this idea that if you’re not with us, you’re against us. To a certain extent, I agree. But I also believe that there is a time and a place for a movement, versus taking a step back 
            and examining what the finish line even looks like. Sometimes I think we get lost in the midst of war and forget what we’re really fighting for. We fight for our rights of course, but we 
            also fight for a world with less fear, more safety, less sacrifice, more comfort. There needs to be some separation between: this is <strong>what</strong> I am, and this is what <strong>I am</strong>. This is something we 
            must work tirelessly towards if we ever truly want some form of closure. If not, we will be bound to the words reserved for our epitaph rather than the actions that we took to reserve them.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, what does this fight look like? I think it takes place from moment to moment. It takes different shapes in different conversations. It manifests in how we treat each other, and how we 
            react to new information. It bleeds through tone and intention. Things that are better made when built upon trust, and honest attempts to reach toward the heart. An implicitly curious and 
            safe environment must be maintained to come to broader cooperation and understanding. We must be willing to have those conversations. We must be willing to give up some of ourselves in 
            exchange for some of each other. Make no mistake, this will be difficult. Change does not come without short-term pain, but if we are not capable of giving and being vulnerable then we are 
            not human. This principle is built into our very foundation, it must only be uncovered through patience and kindness. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A big picture is big but only when we make it appear big. This is not some lofty, thirty year long plan that we start working towards later. No, it’s a mentality change in you, and the people 
            around you, and the people around them, and the people around them. It’s a change that resonates and builds in your core as soon as you are done reading this sentence. It’s a change that 
            will spread because hatred moves fast but love moves strong. We will make time for the stragglers and make room for mistakes, because we already know how hard that can be. A better world 
            exists. Not in our heads as a dream but as a real physical place that we could inhabit tomorrow if we wanted to. The revolution will not be televised; the only way we will see it, is if 
            we commit ourselves completely. Right here, right now, today and tomorrow, and every day after.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finding my bisexuality has given me a new life that I could not be more grateful for, but I’m not bisexual. I’m Jackson. Bisexuality is a part of who I am but it does not define me. 
            Rather, it informs the way I move. It gives me the opportunity to better explore the world as I experience it, through my own lens, at my own pace. Who I am fluctuates and changes, 
            sometimes minute by minute, but through everything I am still me.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>I am proud to be bisexual, but above all else and against all odds, I am proud to be Jackson.</strong>

            Thank you for reading. Part of the reason I write this blog is to communicate things that I think are important and part of it is to sit down and wrestle with my thoughts until I come to 
            know myself a little bit better. My hope is that, through this blog, you learned something about yourself, as I have. Life is tough. I try to think about the little things to keep me 
            centered, but sometimes it feels like you aren’t allowed to live the way you want. That’s okay. Do your best to take things one step at a time. I promise that everything will be alright 
            in the end. Grab a drink, sing a song, tell someone that they mean something to you. Thanks for kicking it, I’ll see you soon.
