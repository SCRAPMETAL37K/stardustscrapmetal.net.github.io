        <h2>Dreaming of Snake River</h2>
        <h3>November 8, 2025 - 8:55 PM</h3>
        
        <p>
            For the first time in a long time, I feel as though I am grasping back. Back to or from what? I don’t know. All I know is that I’m squeezing and readjusting to squeeze more. 
            Something exists that I want. I want it more than I’ve ever wanted anything but I’m not sure if I have the strength to get there. Even if I could, would I even be worthy of it? 
            Or would I realize it was just another waste of time? More than that, it would be a waste of a first time in a long time. What deters me is not the fear of failure, nor the having 
            taken aim and having sliced a bit left, but the knowing that it did exist or that it could have existed. I could have seen and lived it and now it's gone. I’ve squandered it, I’ve 
            squashed it. Utterly and completely. Now it’s gone. It was always gone. That should hurt us. And it does.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about Ohio since I moved back recently. Ohio was home to me. It always has been. I can’t shake this feeling though. That it’s eating me alive. It’s 
            so real to me that I’m not even sure it’s worth explaining. Ohio is everything to me. It is where I grew up, it is who I am, it has defined every corner of my own understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
            I never liked the phrase, “we are products of our environment,” because at its core it is a very dehumanizing phrase. It eviscerates our agency in exchange for an answer that is all too 
            easy to be correct. Yet, it is the reality I come to understand more and more as the grand scheme progresses. We are who we are because of the people and spaces that inhabit our nearest 
            perspective. It is undeniable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course we, at the helm, steer the ship in the direction we would like it to go. I wonder though, how much of our destination do we owe the tides that whisk or the winds that whisper? 
            Deep in all our subconscious lies Ohio’s earthen mantle. We would like to believe that we steer the ship and we alone lead the crew to a land of milk and honey, but the way I see it, the 
            tectonic plates shake us further than we could ever hope to. 
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            There is this understanding among the tourists and the outsiders that Ohio is a strange place. One filled with infinitely sprawling drab and an ever-pervasive melange anger directed at 
            anything that stabs us the wrong way. To a certain extent, I echo that understanding. I have felt those things. They are maybe less so the spicy sauce to the curry, like how they are 
            commonly portrayed, and more so the bay leaves and the broth to a chicken noodle soup. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Past the spiky exterior is a tender meat. One that aches in confusion. Why are we here? Did we deserve this? What will you allow me to be? These are questions I think everyone from Ohio 
            asks themselves, whether they know it or not. We, and by extension I, really are products of the soy bean farms and steel mills we seem to innately know like the inside of our shirts. 
            The movie that plays in the background of my mind is rendered through white washed jeans, a six pack of Windex, and a 2018 Navy Blue Ford F-150 STX.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are not exaggerations, this is my life blood and there is nothing I can do about it. I will always have this way of thinking. I think it drives some people crazy. It got to me too 
            at one point. Standing in the face of an immovable anxiety, how are you supposed to cope with that? I don’t blame them for just lying down and tanking it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some people want to use that energy and point fingers. Either at the powers that be or the other within. I guess I’m not interested in that so much. We can solve your political problems, 
            whichever way your pendulum swings it doesn’t matter. In the end we will still be here. We will still have to reckon with this state, because we are trapped here. Yes, even you.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Like flies to fly paper, when Ohio reaches for you, the struggle is already over. Everyone in my life from Ohio has this certain attachment to this strange place. It feels like everyone 
            wants to leave but no one is actually able. We all understand that somewhere else there exists a place for us that makes more sense, that feels right and true. It is a cruel joke that 
            none of us are able to make a focused effort to actually achieve that, right? Of course there are the lucky few who do find their forever home, but they always end up coming back.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growing up, me and all of the people I was surrounded by were told that we would one day do great things. We were bright and curious and “ahead of the game.” It felt like the stars were 
            aligning and everyone was trying their best to help us get there. Maybe for our parents, our teachers, and our mentors, they knew they had already lost. The next generation, through the 
            passing of our guardians learned mistakes onto us, maybe we would be able to strike through the great barrier. That would be enough for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            But how many of us is that? I look back on my peers and ask, what have we become? We were not stars but their stars. Our guardians believed because they had no other choice, not because 
            we truly saw the way out. We were just people. No different than any other random group of people. Some of us intelligent, some of us kind, some of us stuck believing in a dream sold to 
            us by liars and thieves who themselves did not know they were lying or stealing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The guardians sold us the same lie that was sold to them by the politicians, the cable brokers, the casinos, the banks, and the rest of the corporate congregation. Despite the fact that 
            they knew it was a lie, they had discovered the truth for themselves and yet they continued to hope that it might be true.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>“You could win it big if you tried.”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Look around us. Does it feel like any of us have won? Are there astronauts and brain surgeons, and pop stars in this crowd tonight? Today, when I dust off those old memories, all I see 
            are cowards. People, who knew deep down in their heart what could have been. People, who felt the pulse, no, the scream of passion and desire, and they killed it. They traded their freedom 
            into GameStop for a pitiful college degree or a job at their Dad’s roofing company. Not that those are inherently bad things, but they were never inherently us.
        </p>

        <p>
            This, is Ohio. A legion of people who find themselves toiling to please somebody else, and in doing so, leave themselves unpleased. The more optimistic might call that noble. To me, 
            it's nothing short of sickening.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I am at odds with myself. How could I call this place home? I have seen the trap get constructed. I know how every piece is made. I know how to put the entire trap together. I have seen 
            people paint the trap, make it theirs. I have seen people acknowledge the trap, I have heard them explain to me how it is dangerous and idiotic to fall into it, and I have seen these 
            same people willingly walk into it themselves and exclaim how it was on purpose. Now I live in this land of tricks. I lived here once and I came back. How stupid do I have to be?
        </p>

        <p>
            When I was younger, I longed for the day that I would leave. I thought I would leave and I would run as far as anyone would let me and I would never look back. But I look back every day. 
            It’s impossible not to. Ohio lives on the surface of my eyelids. The lens through which I see is Ohio. Truthfully, it exhausts me. It will continue, for as long as I eat and drink it will 
            continue to exhaust me, but there’s nothing I can do. I’m not dumb enough to walk into the trap like everyone else, but I am dumb enough to wrestle with it into eternity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>So let’s wrestle.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            What is home? I’ve spent years trying to answer that question and I’ll gladly spend more. Home is something I’m constantly trying to find. I don’t think I’ve ever had a home. Maybe it's 
            a really simple question. I could just say, home is where I’m from, the East side of Cleveland. Or maybe it’s where I live now in Columbus. To me, this answer is too simple. And it’s not 
            friends or family. That’s a little too on the nose. Instead, I think I’ll be brave and say, for me, home doesn’t exist right now.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want it to but it just doesn’t. Maybe it did at one point, and I just didn’t notice. Do we have to work to create home, or does home just sort of happen sometimes? Is it a place, an 
            idea, that fuzzy feeling I get when I crack open a new tub of ice cream and feel safe? Or some combination of those things? I don’t know, it’s not that simple.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes I get whiffs of home. I can point at things and say they are home. A keyboard. The carpet. A wooden spoon. These things have home written in their frame, but home is not the 
            math equation I’m making it out to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I guess what I’m trying to say is, there is this dissonance between what a “traditional” idea of home is and what I think it feels like to be “home.”
        </p>

        <p>
            On one hand, what I associate with home is the dull monotony of being in the place where I’m from and remembering all of the reasons I wanted to leave in the first place. I think about 
            the people that I had held so close and the way they have given themselves away to the throes of dangerous thinking. I will not belabor you with specific stories but I have seen friends 
            and family call out to the world in a time of need and Ohio destroyed them in return.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, we all are responsible for each other. Whether they are similar to us or not, it is in some sense our fault when others falter towards the path of least resistance. Then again, 
            who am I to say what others ought to be? If what they have is what they want then why do I feel sad for them? I suppose it is a reminder of the strange cruelty of humanity. Or maybe I’m 
            not really saying anything at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, I think in all of us, there is this need or this want to understand who we are. To find a place or a person or a painting that sends us a message. And when we read that 
            message, we blush and we cry. We buckle under the weight that has been lifted because we can finally let it out. To just be in a space that can really see you and give you a pat on the back.
        </p>

        <p>
            To me, that’s enough to keep searching, keep trying. To understand that this could exist if we try, is the reason I find turning over and giving up to be so disappointing. We can aspire to 
            so much and we can believe in so much more. But we need a guide. Our self alone cannot muster the right way forward on inhibition and gut feeling alone. I need people that see it my way, 
            I need people who can speak to me in a way that I understand. I need Ohio.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m scared of being trapped in Ohio forever. It sounds childish just typing it out now, but I’m being honest. I knew from a young age that I wanted to leave, that leaving would give me 
            the opportunity to do so many things that I would never be able to do here.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve heard stories from family about how they have always wanted to leave. How they had a dream of doing some great big thing, but when the going got tough, they gave up on that. I’ve also 
            heard the stories from family about how they did leave, and they realized the world was too big for them, and so they came back. I’ve seen what this place does. It demoralizes, sucks the 
            soul out of your body and laughs at you for ever thinking you could’ve been something.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t want to be that. I don’t have to be that. But I can’t quite leave everything behind either. To give up the way I see the world isn’t impossible, but it’s also not realistic.
        </p>

        <p>
            We live in a world where the people we hate are not allowed to change. In our minds, we trap them in a hyperbolic time chamber where they cannot learn or grow in any way, so that we may 
            continue to hate them. They are permanently stuck in our memory banks the way we last experienced them. But how cruel of us is this? They do and will change. Constantly. We are all stuck 
            changing all the time, whether or not we actually want to admit it. We cannot deny our change, no matter how painful it is or how long it takes. When we reach a temporary state of 
            stillness, only then can we appreciate how we have grown. We can also let the people around us grow, but we have to be okay with letting go of what we had, so that we are open enough to 
            accept something new. We should let people change.
        </p>

        <p>
            We should let home change too.
        </p>

        <p>
            I should let it be what it wants to be. Maybe then, I’ll get a little closer to what I want to be. Or maybe not. Maybe that’s just Ohio talking.
        </p>

            Hey! Thanks for reading! One of my goals this year was to write one of these every month. As I have fallen embarrassingly short of that goal, I hope that means that every time I have put 
            something out, I’ve actually had something meaningful and worthwhile to say. And hopefully you’ve actually gotten something out of it. Anyway, I hope you’re doing alright and staying warm. 
            Go tell someone you love them, it's tough out here. Thanks again for kicking it, I’ll see you soon.
