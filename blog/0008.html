        <h2>So Softly, So Long Ago</h2>
        <h3>January 28, 2026 - 12:53 AM</h3>
        
        <p>
            Today was cold. Colder than it has been in a long time, and maybe the coldest it will be all year. Packed inside and wrapped in a blanket, shielding myself from the snowstorm that’s 
            pounded the front door of my apartment for the past two days, I look outside my window. It faces a main road and a busy intersection. Ever since I’ve moved here, and at my last apartment 
            as well, the cars have never stopped. Like an ever-dripping tap, the cars create a wind tunnel that scrapes at the glass panes. Even into the late hours of the night a distant echo of 
            rubber on asphalt can be heard piercing the shadows between. Except today.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today it was too cold. Too snowy, too dangerous for anyone to consider. When Mother Nature arrives, we pay attention. It is kind of a beautiful but stark reminder that we are not all that 
            we think we are. We can build roads. We can make machines that use the roads to move at incredible speeds. We can make systems and algorithms, hosted by space lasers no less, that sort 
            through every possible combination of road we could take and it tells us the most optimal route. And if the first route has too much traffic on I-71 South, here’s the second most optimal 
            route. Just for you! Then Mother Nature, who has traveled using the most optimal route of them all (the sky), shows us that we are nothing. In what feels like the blink of an eye, the 
            space we carved away for cars and for the veins that connect our swaths of spires falls under a weighted comforter twelve inches deep. Immovable and only truly removable by a greater but 
            opposite temperature. Mother Nature said, “Effective immediately, be quiet.”
        </p>

        <p>
            And so we were quiet. The only sounds that surround me now are the quiet hum of my computer and the air conditioning. Together they sing atonal harmonies between the clattering of my 
            keyboard and the occasional snow plow that passes by. I hate the sounds of the cars. The honking, the tire screech, the revving of a souped-up-engine that’s more akin to an asthma attack 
            than anything the driver meant for it to convey. These are all noises of worry. All inherently unsettling and rooted in something dangerous. Now that these noises are gone though, I find 
            myself unsettled in the nothing that replaced it. The something was bad, but at least it was something.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I look out my window now, watching as the red of the sunset filtered by the storm clouds releases a deep purple-ish gray found only in the winter. The street lamp flickers on in a familiar 
            yellowy-orange glow. As I squint, the street lamp makes diamonds in the crystals of my out of focus lens. My eyelids grow heavy. Hungry for a nothing of their own. Do I leave the blinds 
            open tonight? For the first time the trees will be able to whisper into my golden safety without the howling highway to break their signal. The mattress calls. I answer. “I’m on my way.” 
            I was already there.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under the weight of something, my body falls off. The skin blends into the cotton sheets as they melt into the foam beneath them. My bones curl into a ball, trying to find the right 
            combination of spokes that lift the pins in the lock. The saliva becomes a static volume that fills the cavities of my insides. I feel. I feel. Before I knew it, I met nothing. In its 
            velvet robe, it swallows me with the delicate touch of a cat’s whisker brushing against my face. Hard angles no longer exist, as they are rendered completely useless by the physics of 
            this infinite dawn.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like sugar to coffee, the blackness fades into the euphoric creamy bliss like it had always been here. A frailty and a looseness is understood. Now that you know, you can never go back. 
            Nothing could wrestle you out of the skeleton’s hand. Quarks ooze into a yet incomprehensible smaller thing, bleeding with the force of a stampede of bison and at the speed of a drunk 
            slug. There is nothing you know now, only that your journey has just begun. But as soon as it all started, it stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            As if a magician somewhere snapped, I came to, in my room, under those sheets. My eyes force their way open. The laptop charger dimly blinks its own morse code-esque language in the corner. 
            The street lamp streams in through the window still. It’s still early in the morning. I pull the other pillow in between my arms and legs, partly hoping it will take me back, and partly 
            knowing that there’s no action I could take that would quelch my mind’s thirst for–and then my alarm goes off. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I stumble into the cold atmosphere, shaking a little. I try turning off my alarm three times and fail before getting it on the fourth. I move toward the bathroom. The little time spent in 
            transit between the bedroom and the bathroom is soon to vanish from my memory. I find the light switch and knowingly blind myself with the force of a thousand suns. The incandescent bulbs 
            are just as sharp as the icicles that hang from the gutters. As my double vision adjusts to my own image in the mirror, I feel my chest, tender and battered from a battle I never fought. 
            My ribs are covered with tattoos of a primal and alien language. One that cannot be comprehended with human senses.
        </p>

        <p>
            The heat of the water from the shower jolts me out of my daze. I remember the opening lines to Mitski’s song, "I Will."
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>“I will take good care of you / I will take good care of you / Everything you feel is good / if you would only let you.”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            I sing the lines quietly to myself, partly hoping that it will take me back, and partly preparing myself for the day to break. Will I ever feel ready? Will I ever feel at ease? 
            And if I feel at ease, how will I know that it’s true? I guess I’m not there yet.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Some mornings, when I have no obligation to be awake, I turn the alarm off and just lay there. I moan and stretch before turning over and readjusting my pillow. I’m awake. I know I’m 
            awake. I should get up. But there’s a call I can’t ignore. Whether it's a hand from the shadows or a subconscious urge, it does not matter. I answer every time. But I know it's empty. 
            And I know it’s safe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe that’s all that matters. Maybe it is enough to say that we have something. We can just have a space and a time that doesn’t need to be defined or explained to anyone. It is fully our 
            own. Maybe it is enough to say that we are here. That we are matter and we do matter. That this time matters, because I can control it and I am able to let go and still be me. In a world 
            where chaos moves so fast and so slow simultaneously, maybe this is all we can really ask for. Even with all of our ambition and desire, undeniable is our hunger to stop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes I think I want to make things out to be bigger than they are. I believe in reason and choice and an orderly universe that behaves when I tell it to. I feel cowardly and afraid 
            when I do something selfish. I believe we can examine the way we feel to understand something about the way we experience. But recently I’ve learned to accept that sometimes, I won’t find 
            any answers. That we can just be how we are and appreciate it for what it is. I’ve learned to move in it, I think. Or I’m learning to move in it. I don’t know, and that’s okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            Just lay in bed for a little while. I’m here. <strong>Right here, right now.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            How beautiful it is to be anything at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks for reading! I’m not sure if this one is going to make sense to you, but I know that it is true to who I am, which is why I’ve put it out. I guess that’s why I write, to get closer 
            to myself in some way. Hopefully my words have been able to be a friend to you, as they have been a friend to me. Go get some rest. You’ve earned it. Thanks for kicking it! I’ll see you 
            soon.
