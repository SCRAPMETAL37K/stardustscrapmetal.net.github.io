        <h2>Fault Lines</h2>
        <h3>March 2, 2025 - 1:12 AM</h3>
        
        <p>
            I’m being told this isn’t how it's supposed to be. It pulses in purples and reds, oscillating in and out like the electric hum of a synthesizer. I can feel it writhe. Every stretch, 
            crack, and slither. The idea of control is something that I continue to wrestle with. Some days it latches on to my arm and I spend all of my peace of mind trying to pry myself free 
            from its ever-encroaching overture. Other days it feels as if I’m being watched. From a fly on the wall or a distant pair of steel-toe boots rummaging through boxes of yesterday’s 
            problems. Other days I openly beg for its attention. Its uniquely present absence is a cruel joke paid for by my own pathetic attempt to relieve the apprehension. Thoughts of other 
            days are flanked by camouflaged malaise. An acid maze, steeped in recommended praise stops the strobe lights from singing their protest song, but for how long and who will actually 
            listen? I have never had anywhere else to go. So please, just tell me.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            My eyes keep darting towards my bedroom window. I’m not really sure what I keep expecting to be there. Maybe an animal or a delivery truck. Maybe I’ll know the next person that walks by.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was never great at making friends growing up. I was always thrust into it too quickly to figure out what to say so I didn't come off like a dweeb. I’d trip over my words like writing 
            then deleting the same two sentences over and over again in an empty word document.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>“These people are cool, you can’t just tell them you like video games. That’s not good enough.”</i>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Stupid little kid thoughts, right? It’s scary how similar we are now to who we were then. It makes all of those growing pains seem unnecessary in hindsight. Through it all though, you 
            are still you. I have changed, but the spirit that was there earlier in my life is still there now. We have conversations every day, multiple times a day. I’d like to believe that I’m 
            more patient, more understanding, more accepting, more empathetic, more trusting, but despite all of that, there’s still something else blocking the way forward. A proper fear.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            You can learn how to become more courageous. You can learn how to become more charismatic. Those are tangible characteristics that we can measure with our own sense of self. Fear, on 
            the other hand, is much more daunting. It's always just out of reach. Impossible to control on your own. Fear feasts on itself. Once it consumes all you have to give, it will continue 
            to thrive on its past success. I never considered myself fearful. If anything, I considered others harsh. I thought being brave was being backed into a corner and being okay with it. 
            As long as I was one ledge above the danger, then there were no issues. This is just the way it is. This is the world we live in. One that teaches you that not only is everyone against 
            you, but you are the only one who cares. You will learn to live or you will die trying. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew very early on that my brain wasn’t compatible with other people. Every interaction I had was like trying to get inside a nuclear reactor with a house key. I was always afraid of 
            outing myself as not of the same mind. What little social progress I made could be ripped away with one unsubstantial, out-of-the-park remark. I don’t know, maybe this is coming off as 
            too melodramatic. I was a relatively normal kid, and this is not a unique case. We’ve all heard this story told to us before by all the big movie studios and self help gurus. This is the 
            farthest thing from anything new. So, let me get to the point.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What kind of world do you want to live in? What kind of future should we foster?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            When we push people away, when we isolate, alienate, and other, we effectively tell them to lash out. That’s what I did. I went to the edge and came back with vengeance. All that stuff 
            I said about having no friends was a lie. I had several friends. I had friends that cared about me, I had friends that stood by my side during difficult times, and I was the friend that 
            wouldn’t do the same. All I knew how to do was make people feel the way I did. I did all the “good friend” stuff because that’s what you were supposed to do, not because I meant it. I 
            pushed people away when they got too close because I was unsure of what that could become. I was never afraid of making the friends, I was afraid of having become the friend and failing 
            to be something I never fully understood. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I pushed one friend away because he asked for my phone number. I pushed another friend away because he became depressed and I didn’t understand how to help. I pushed a third friend away 
            because I was the only friend he had. I think about them every day. Part of me can’t stand that I used to be that person, and the other part of me still is that person.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            I took it all for granted. I knew exactly what I had and was surprised that it disappeared when I let it go. I was petrified of being seen as a failure and did everything in my power 
            to keep that from happening, yet I failed anyway. I’ve spent enough time moping about and meandering, hoping to run into something that solves the problem for me. My behavior was 
            embarrassing, disappointing, and now I have to own that. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been shown nothing but kindness over the years. Around every corner, a friend has been there. Always willing to outstretch an arm and pick me back up. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember Gennaro was the first to approach me at recess on the first day I switched schools. He was always more willing to get going, to get people moving. He showed me how to bring
            people together.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember Paul was the first person to really take me into his world. We rode quad bikes and shot BB guns in his backyard. He showed me how to be authentically yourself and not 
            really care what other people thought. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember Joey was the first to let everyone know that they were gonna be okay. He was always ready to stand up for you and mean it. He showed me how to be kind.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember Attilio was the first to entertain. A true showman in every sense of the word. He played a character of himself for the benefit of everyone quick enough to catch his quips. 
            He showed me how to believe fully in myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember Kieran, who I cried next to in math class that one time. Elliott and Zachary, who built LEGO’s with me. Sam, who I ran cross country with. Matthew, who sat with me at lunch 
            in high school when I normally sat alone. There’s Henry and Zach. Massimo and Angelo. Emma, Frank, Haoan, Lily, Alexander, Ellie, Joe, Tayo, Grant, I could go on. Some of them I was only 
            able to get to know for a little more than a year, some have been with me damn near my whole life at this point. I am thankful now for every moment anyone has ever extended. They’ve 
            shaped me and molded me into who I am today. Whether they like it or not, they were there and they are a part of me forever.
        </p>

        <p>
            I owe all of you, a deeply serious and long overdue thank you. You’ve given me so much of yourself for so little in return. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            I owe all of you an apology. Most of you will probably shrug it off, we were younger back then. Shit happens. It meant more than that to me. I saw the options in my head and chose to 
            turn away. I’m sorry, I know now how I hurt you, and I know now that many of us will never cross paths again. I think that’s okay. We existed together in the moments where we needed to. 
            I don’t know, I think that’s enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>I ask you again, what kind of world do you want to live in?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ll answer first. I want to live in a world where we care. I want to see people lift each other up. I want to take you out to dinner and get to your core. I want to endeavor to 
            understand your complete world. I want to share that with others. I want to believe in our unified strength. I want to see us summit new mountains and meet someone at the top who 
            convinces us to summit another. I want to see the friend in everything, everywhere, all of the time. In cobwebs, lily pads, graffiti tags, stickers, Steam profile pages, custom 
            playlists, and all the food you make. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I think we’re close. I think we’ve always been right there. At least, I hope so. I never liked hope. It always felt like a false promise to me. It takes the agency away from us. 
            Why try when you can hope? If we all just hope, then who will actually do? I encourage you to break free from that. To be someone that does something. It doesn’t have to be big. 
            You might not even realize you’ve done it. Whatever that is, it's inside you right now. I know it is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone is a friend to someone. Don’t believe me? Boom! I’m your friend right now. It's that easy. The capacity to care is only given by your willingness to acknowledge that you can. 
            We are clumsy and fragile beings. We will make mistakes. If given the opportunity, I am certain we would choose to knock over the fine china one hundred percent of the time. Not because 
            we are malicious, but because we lack the foresight to do what is best. What happens next is up to you. We can leave it for others to walk upon, or we can grab the super glue. I know 
            what world I want to live in, I believe you do too.
        </p>

        <p>
            ...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Okay, that was a lot. I can’t believe you read all that. I just wanted to let you know that I care about you, and I wish you the best, as always. If you’ve been feeling lost or alone 
            recently, just remember that the sun will rise again tomorrow. Take some time for yourself but also take some time with others. You don’t have to do this by yourself. Grab a sweet treat, 
            tell someone you love them, and go make something with your hands. I promise you’ll feel better. Anyway, thanks for kicking it. I’ll see you soon.
