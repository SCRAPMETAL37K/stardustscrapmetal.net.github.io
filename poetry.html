        <h2>Locking Antlers</h2>
        <h3>November 29, 2025</h3>

        <p>
            ... And then we were stuck,<br>
            of our own feeble accord,<br>
            with half the dance left to go.<br><br>

            Ten petals you did pluck,<br>
            by the blade of your sword,<br>
            in a single swift blow.<br><br>

            If we let the heart run amok,<br>
            to which we can afford,<br>
            will our antlers then glow?<br><br>

            I hope you let me, hope so.
        </p>

        <h2>One Cigarette</h2>
        <h3>October 9, 2025</h3>

        <p>
            Stillness still shivers.<br><br>

            Hollow poles grasp at my mittens.<br>
            Fur lined boots from a friend.<br>
            Cracks in the leather stretch the little dry left.<br>
            Two layers of cotton and twill drag circles on my chest.<br>
            Three pockets of nothing hold the past's best.<br>
            The cage shutters.<br>
            Demanding a foreword, we look back;<br>
            Back at our home,<br>
            back at the cage,<br>
            back at my mittens.<br>
            Like a bag of pretzels or Swedish Fish,<br>
            it was a wise man's bliss.<br>
            You breach the bag,<br>
            its contents horrified and still still.<br>
            Hollow poles hold hollow flags.<br>
            Those boots are thankful;<br>
            Thankful for the wet and the dry,<br>
            thankful for the fur and the cracks,<br>
            thankful for the rope and the slack,<br>
            but stillness still shivers.<br><br>

            No longer looking, now we're staring.<br>
            Staring through sand and grass.<br>
            The ghosts of tree's children wave at the mast like the lighthouse's flash.<br>
            You look out but not away.<br>
            As the turning of the wheel matches movement with a greener place.<br>
            Green like your coat,<br>
            green like the wind,<br>
            green like the sky,<br>
            to pilot the wings you wish you could fly,<br>
            but stillness still shivers.<br><br>

            As gray matter crashes through columns of salt and what few distant dust remains,<br>
            you finally look away.<br>
            Now clenching the pole back,<br>
            embracing its polymer with precaution,<br>
            once you were The Watcher and now it is you who turns the faucet by the handle carved from God's chisel.<br>
            Chisel the stone from the Earth,<br>
            chisel the wings from birth,<br>
            chisel your green coat and your boots and your mittens from the walls that kept you warm and safe and still,<br>
            because stillness still shivers.<br><br>

            Tear the paper on the wall and scribble something inside.<br>
            It could be your name or your address.<br>
            Throw a plate at the wall,<br>
            please by all means, make a mess.<br>
            "What is it that you see or that you saw?<br>
            For you are The Watcher,<br>
            maker of green and gray.<br>
            You thought you could make a house out of clay but all I see are hills and hills and hills.<br>
            It is you who watches them form and who knows.<br>
            Knows of the sea foam,<br>
            knows of its white lie,<br>
            knows of its orange analog filter."<br>
            The pole sinks in from the heat like a curtsy to the core,<br>
            when stillness still shivers.<br><br>

            A rip in your mittens in between the fingers.<br>
            It's time to turn in but the pole begs.<br>
            It begs and it begs and it begs.<br>
            It pleads, it screams, it says,<br>
            "Do you not feel the turbulence?<br>
            Does the shake not bind your soul like the blinds to the darkness or icing to the cake?<br>
            Do you not feel the green or the gray?<br>
            Do you not quiver under cold steel words?<br>
            Do you not pierce the water with lead?<br>
            Do you not hold the foam to your lips and ask for a kiss as it traces lines on your back?<br>
            Do you not hold the curve?<br>
            Do you not influence the rudder in its rudeness?<br>
            You are not The Watcher!<br>
            You are a trick and a cheap!<br>
            A master of deception,<br>
            piecing fragments of frills in boxes every afternoon after.<br>
            You see not the grass that is green nor the smoke that is gray.<br>
            You see red and brown.<br>
            Blood underneath your nails and mud between your fingers.<br>
            You are stuck on an overhang,<br>
            spinning in place.<br>
            Your stamina, macerated by deceit and masqueraded as hope,<br>
            reflected by a shield of mirrors from the sands of somewhere.<br>
            You could have been statues.<br>
            You could have been books.<br>
            You could have been a drum for peace."<br><br>

            "And yet, stillness still shivers," you replied.<br>
            "I was close.<br>
            I was close as any two things could be.<br>
            Like the hair to my face.<br>
            Like the tire to the road.<br>
            Like a pin to a sash.<br>
            Like a branch to its flower.<br>
            Like an animal to its cage.<br>
            And for what?<br>
            I had sauntered along the path of least resistance for a wisdom tooth's time,<br>
            and had not but parted the view from my window.<br>
            I made the tea and the tools to take them far,<br>
            but they had not the coat.<br>
            Stuck in the wash and buried under layers of sediment.<br>
            You could never understand the mittens nor the boots.<br>
            I felt the tremblings, as did you.<br>
            I felt them everyday, even through the boots and through my shield.<br>
            I felt the green and the gray.<br>
            I've felt all that I needed to feel.<br>
            If I find what I lack is the red and the brown then I will take them with me too.<br>
            I felt the foam,<br>
            God yes have I felt the foam.<br>
            And I have felt the steel words.<br>
            I have felt the bones and their marrow,<br>
            the blinds and the shudder,<br>
            the books and the statues,<br>
            the drum and the siren that calls,<br>
            and I would burn it.<br>
            That's right I would burn it.<br>
            I will take it with me and burn it.<br>
            I'm not joking, I will burn it, I really will burn it,<br>
            because you were right about one thing.<br>
            I am not The Watcher.<br>
            I am a liar and thief.<br>
            A beggar and chooser,<br>
            a captain and chief of my only desire,<br>
            who let it slip away under the cruel sheets of paper that leave cuts on my feet.<br>
            I walked for miles.<br>
            I really did, and I think I would do it again if it meant I could be on this boat again.<br>
            I leave only now because I know I don't need to come back to return.<br>
            I have all now.<br>
            I have the land and the sea,<br>
            and all the distance in between.<br>
            I have the stand and the plea,<br>
            and every dollar spent in spree.<br>
            I am made of the grass and the metal,<br>
            the gray and the green.<br>
            I cry for you and the echoes,<br>
            unwilling but able.<br>
            I cry for the signs and the geckos,<br>
            unrelenting yet stable.<br>
            I cry for pain and for truth,<br>
            a stain on my youth.<br>
            I cry for claims and the proof,<br>
            barred from entering a truce.<br>
            I cry because I can,<br>
            because there's nothing I can do,<br>
            because there's nothing left of you.<br>
            Yes, stillness still shivers,<br>
            but you don't have to."
